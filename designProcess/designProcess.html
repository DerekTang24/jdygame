    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <a href="../index.html">Index</a>
    <a href="../instructions/instructions.html">Instructions<a>
    <br>
    <h3>Roles:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Derek will be making the audio sound effects, the player, and the github setup so everyone can work
      together on the project. He will also work on ideas that have been brought up after this.</li>
      <li>Yanis will be working on level generation, weapons, and the pathfinding for the mobs.</li>
      <li>Jonathan will be making the graphics for the characters, code the monsters, besides the
      path finding, and make the menus and game interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jonathan will try his best to create the classes and their basic functions for the monsters by day 2
      then by day 4 make each subclass specific ability. Then on day 5 finish half the menu then have the
      other half finished by day 6. Derek already has the github set up but it needs to be changed a bit.</li>
      <li>Derek will have the player finished by day 2 and the sound effects by day 4.</li>
      <li>Yanis will work on (and try to finish) the hard-coded level generation on day 1. He will work on the
      flexible weapons database by day 2, and hopes to finish it by the end of day 2. He will then work on
      the pathfinding on days 3 and 4, hoping to finish it on day 4. He will then work on random level
      generation for the rest of the time. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Accessibility:</h2>
    <p>We will rely not rely on color to convey any crucial information. Text will only be used to read the rules,
      change the settings, and see the stage level. We will also implement a keybind changer so users who prefer
      to use any other key than WASD can easily change them. For auditory problems, music and sound will only be
      used in order to add more fun to the game. Furthermore, if needs be, the volume will be able to be changed
      within the pause menu. As one of the team members is epileptic, we will not be using bright flashing colors. </p>
